        <p> Euthanasia is the action of intentionally ending a life due to a terminal illness or to relieve pain and suffering. In general it could be split into two types:<br><br>

Passive Euthanasia: The act of stopping life sustaining medication<br>
Active Euthanasia: The act of taking one's life using lethal substances/means<br><br>

Euthanasia has been an increasingly controversial topic worldwide due to its growing prevalence. According to a biennial report of Belgian Commission on Euthanasia Control, the number of euthanasia deaths increase by 27% annually. Currently, many countries officially legalized euthanasia including Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Switzerland, and six US States (California, Colorado, Montana, Oregon, Vermont and Washington State). However, there is still much debate over the legalisation of euthanasia, which is why we would like to provide our opinion on this issue, specifically, regarding the situation in Hong Kong.

<div style="background-color: #EFF0F1; margin-top: 1em;">
  <p style="display: inline;" id='p3' >Dear Hong Kong Department of Health,<br><br>

We are a Hong Kong-based Y11 IGCSE Global Perspectives team aiming to spread awareness and to demonstrate a need for the legalization of euthanasia. Currently, in Hong Kong, the law states that active euthanasia is completely illegal and unethical under all circumstances, and we would like to provide our opinion on this issue.We are aware that passive euthanasia (the act of stopping a patient’s life-sustaining medication under the circumstances that the patient is terminally ill, in a coma and mentally competent to make decisions) is currently legal in Hong Kong. However, our main incentive for supporting euthanasia is that it would result in a painless death. Passive euthanasia would not meet that requirement since stopping medication would lead to the patient feeling the full agony of the disease during his/her last days. We believe that we speak on behalf of the general population in that a death without pain should be provided at least as an alternative option to those suffering from terminal illnesses. <br><br>

A survey was conducted in order to gather opinions from a wide range of different perspectives. It included definitions of professional terms to ensure the integrity of the data. As our survey was a cross-cultural inspection on the perspectives of many cultures and nationalities, we were able to gather information from a range of religions and backgrounds. Our survey results prove that not only does religion or nationality lack impact on stances on euthanasia, but even 92.1% of our survey participants found euthanasia to be ethical. When given the circumstance of suffering from a painful terminal illness, 65.8% of the respondents chose active euthanasia, and 81.6% would not object to the legislation of euthanasia. <br><br>

In addition, when considering the wellbeing of their loved ones, many survey participants believed that loved ones suffering from a terminal illness have the right to choose whether they live or die. This indicates a belief that, ultimately, the choice of whether to live or die in the event of suffering should be left to the individual themselves; therefore this supports the need for active euthanasia to be open as a choice.<br><br>

A student currently in their 4th year studying medicine in The University of Hong Kong (HKU) was also interviewed, in which he stated that the majority of people in the medical profession support euthanasia as it abides the 4 medical ethics: nonmaleficence, beneficience, justice and autonomy. Since euthanasia alleviates pain while staying within the boundaries of medical ethics, from a purely medical perspective euthanasia is very desirable.  <br><br>

In our humble opinion, not only do our survey results support our perspective, but the majority of the medical industry also agree that euthanasia is ethical. Consequently, the Department of Health should consider making allowances to Active Euthanasia (within a set of regulations) in order to provide relief to those suffering from a terminal illness. <br><br>

Regards,<br>
Kylie, Audrey, and Vincent.<br><br>
